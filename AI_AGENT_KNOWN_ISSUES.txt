AI/LLM KNOWN ISSUES LOG:

********AI 1

- Issue: p5.js background animation not playing/motionless on some page loads.
- Common cause: Canvas is created before parent container is visible or sized, or p5.js sketch is not re-triggered after AJAX/SPA content load.
- Step-by-step resolution:
  1. Always use an explicit initialization check (IntersectionObserver or container size polling) before starting p5 sketch.
  2. Destroy and re-create p5 instances on AJAX/SPA navigation to avoid “hung” canvases.
  3. Confirm no duplicate canvases are present in DOM.
  4. Confirm canvas container is sized before initializing (wait for element size, not just DOMContentLoaded).
- Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: GSAP/SplitText animations not triggering or animating only on first load.
- Common cause: SplitText lines are not re-split after AJAX/SPA navigation, or ScrollTrigger not refreshed.
- Step-by-step resolution:
  1. After each AJAX/SPA content change, rerun SplitText setup on relevant elements.
  2. Call `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after DOM changes or animation injection.
  3. Double-check selectors match new page content structure.

- Issue: Dot grid and haze backgrounds are not visually consistent across “load wave” and “main” backgrounds.
- Common cause: Responsive logic or color config diverges between two background modes; p5 instances using different grid/dot/size settings.
- Step-by-step resolution:
  1. Centralize grid/dot color and sizing config in one JS module.
  2. Always use the same responsive logic for grid on all backgrounds.
  3. Test on mobile and desktop—ensure breakpoints behave identically in all background variants.

- Issue: Editing in Semplice causes invisible cursor over p5 canvas.
- Common cause: Semplice admin/editor overlays or iFrames conflicting with pointer/cursor events on canvas layer.
- Step-by-step resolution:
  1. In admin mode, set `pointer-events: auto` or remove `pointer-events: none` on canvas temporarily.
  2. Ensure z-index and stacking does not hide cursor over editable areas.
  3. Consider toggling canvas visibility or interaction based on editing state.
- Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: Animations or reveals break on mobile or very wide screens.
- Common cause: Dot grid or mask sizing not responsive, or sections losing 100vh height.
- Step-by-step resolution:
  1. Audit `getResponsiveGridSettings()` or equivalent responsive code.
  2. Use CSS `min-height: 100vh` for all full-bleed animated sections.
  3. Test and tweak for all device widths in browser.
- Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

********AI 2

ISSUE: Hero Section (Section 1) animation logic breaks if DOM structure or markup changes.
WHEN: Hero headline markup is updated, or SplitText is re-applied.
EXPECTED: Mask-in/mask-out works regardless of markup; SplitText wrappers only applied once.

ISSUE: "Select Projects" (Section 2) title animation trigger unreliable.
WHEN: On mobile, resize, or fast scroll between sections 1 and 3.
EXPECTED: "Select Projects" title always exits before first project title animates in; no overlap.

ISSUE: Project section modularity not robust.
WHEN: Manual application of classes (e.g. .project-section--[project-name]) is missed or duplicated.
EXPECTED: Each project triggers correct dot nav, entry/exit animation, and is scrollable via nav dot.

ISSUE: Dot navigation ("scroll-to-dot") fails when multiple project sections are in viewport.
WHEN: Wide or tall viewports, rapid scrolling, or slow device performance.
EXPECTED: Only one dot is visible and active at any scroll position.

ISSUE: Background p5.js canvas elements stack on SPA/page transitions.
WHEN: Navigating via SPA, content reload, or appending new sections.
EXPECTED: Only one canvas per background type is present; old canvases are destroyed on transition.

ISSUE: SplitText wrapper classes (.masked-line/.masked-line-inner) become inconsistent on DOM updates.
WHEN: Animations are re-initialized or SplitText runs multiple times on same element.
EXPECTED: Only one set of wrappers per line; animation code is idempotent.

ISSUE: Pinning logic for sections 1–8 conflicts with Semplice layout changes.
WHEN: Semplice updates DOM, or nested wrappers are modified in editor.
EXPECTED: Only background is pinned between sections 1–8, with no overlay/content conflicts.

ISSUE: Final project/About transition is abrupt or not responsive.
WHEN: About section enters or viewport is changed.
EXPECTED: Final project remains pinned and transitions smoothly until About fully covers; responsive to viewport.

ISSUE: Test/dummy selectors remain in codebase.
WHEN: Updating selector log, refactoring, or releasing production code.
EXPECTED: Only live, intentional selectors present; test classes are cleaned up.

ISSUE: Selector log/manual documentation out-of-sync with current code.
WHEN: New selectors or modules added.
EXPECTED: AI_AGENT_SELECTOR_LOG.txt and this file always reflect current state; update automated if possible.

********AI 3

AI/LLM KNOWN ISSUES LOG:

- Issue: Section-1 pin/reveal not initializing or unpinning correctly.
  Common cause: ScrollTrigger instance created before content is fully loaded or incorrect trigger/end elements.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Delay ScrollTrigger.create() until after full page load (e.g. wrap in `window.onload` or ScrollTrigger’s refresh).
    2. Verify `.brandon-section1-pin` and `#about-section` selectors exist when ScrollTrigger runs.
    3. Use `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after SPA/AJAX content injection.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: Intro copy animates out immediately on load.
  Common cause: “start: 'top -=25%'” scroll position fires before user scrolls.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Change `start: "top -=25%"` to an absolute viewport-based trigger (e.g. `"bottom top-=25%"`).
    2. Or add an offset: `start: "top top+=25%"`.
    3. Test with markers to confirm correct timeline activation.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: SplitText called before fonts loaded.
  Common cause: GSAP SplitText runs immediately on DOMContentLoaded, before web fonts finish loading.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Wrap `new SplitText()` calls inside a `FontFaceObserver` or `document.fonts.ready.then(...)`.
    2. Or delay hero animation until `window.onload`.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: GSAP/SplitText animations only work on first load.
  Common cause: On SPA navigation, new content is injected without re-running SplitText and ScrollTrigger registration.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Listen for `sempliceAppendContent` and re-run your hero and copy animations.
    2. Call `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after appending.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: Nav menu (mediaelement) broke after dequeuing conflicting scripts.
  Common cause: Over-eager dequeue of any script whose URL contains “mediaelement”.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Target only the exact handles throwing errors (`mediaelement-and-pla`, `mediaelement-migrate`).
    2. Use `wp_dequeue_script('mediaelement-and-pla')` only, and avoid bulk deregister of all mediaelement scripts.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: p5.js canvas not showing or animating on some loads.
  Common cause: Canvas initialized before container has width/height or before SPA content injection.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Poll for container size (e.g. `waitForElementSizeAndInit`) before calling `new p5()`.
    2. Use `IntersectionObserver` to start/stop sketch only when section enters viewport.
    3. Destroy old canvas and re-create on SPA navigation.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: “semplice is not defined” errors in console.
  Common cause: Attempting to call `semplice.animate.gsap(...)` before Semplice’s global object is available.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Wrap any `semplice.*` calls in a check, e.g. `if (window.semplice) { … }`.
    2. Or listen for Semplice’s own events before initialization (`sempliceAppendContent`).
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: Dot grid / haze backgrounds inconsistent.
  Common cause: Two separate p5 factories use slightly different responsive breakpoints.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Consolidate `getResponsiveGridSettings()` into a single imported module.
    2. Use identical parameters for all background types.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: Project-section selectors out of sync with code.
  Common cause: Manual class names in Semplice editor don’t exactly match your JavaScript selectors.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Inspect actual `smp-section` markup for your custom classes.
    2. Update `document.querySelectorAll(...)` selectors to match those exact class names.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: ScrollTrigger markers show mis-placed start/end points.
  Common cause: `start`/`end` definitions use relative offsets that don’t align with actual section heights.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Temporarily enable `markers: true` to visually debug.
    2. Adjust `start`/`end` lines to pixel values if percentage-based triggers misbehave.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

- Issue: Full JS files were abbreviated in patches, causing missing functionality.
  Common cause: Partial code snippets in replies rather than full script.
  Step-by-step resolution:
    1. Always deliver the **entire** `brandon-custom-scripts.js` file with every update.
    2. Wrap updates in clear comment blocks so copy/paste is seamless.
  Confirm understanding clearly: [Yes/No] ______

## Known Issues & Conflicts Log - Semplice Child Theme

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-15 23:55:56 UTC

---

**Issue #1: P5.js Background Initialization Failure ("Max wait time reached")**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   P5.js canvas/sketch is not visible on the page.
    *   Console error: `[BRANDON CUSTOM] P5 Init: Max wait time reached for "[sketch-label]". Could not initialize.`
*   **Potential Causes & Diagnostics:**
    1.  **Container Dimensions:** The HTML element intended to host the P5 canvas (e.g., `div.brandon-main-background`) or its direct parent (e.g., `smp-section.brandon-bg-main-bg`) might lack explicit `width` and `height` at the time of P5 initialization. If the parent section has 0 height (e.g., because it only contains absolutely positioned children or has no content to give it height), a P5 container div styled with `height: 100%` will also resolve to 0 height.
        *   **Check:** Log dimensions of the P5 container and its parent section during the `waitForElementSizeAndInit` function.
        *   **Fix:** Ensure the Semplice section (`smp-section.brandon-bg-...`) has an explicit CSS `min-height` (e.g., `100vh`) or `height`. Ensure the dynamically injected P5 container `div` is styled to fill this parent (e.g., `position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;`). The parent section should be `position: relative`.
    2.  **JavaScript Syntax Errors:** A JS syntax error elsewhere in the custom script can halt execution before P5.js initialization code runs or corrupts its execution.
        *   **Check:** If all custom console logs disappear, suspect a syntax error. Use browser DevTools to identify it.
        *   **Fix:** Correct the syntax error.
    3.  **Timing Issues:** P5.js might attempt to initialize before the DOM is fully ready or styled.
        *   **Fix:** The `waitForElementSizeAndInit` function with a timeout and retry mechanism is designed to handle this, but ensure it's robust. Explicitly styling the P5 container div upon creation can also help.
*   **Resolution (from session):** Corrected a JS syntax error in `createSafeP5Instance` (v2.6.7.8). Ensured P5 container div is explicitly styled with `position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%;` and its parent `smp-section` is `position:relative`. Added more detailed dimension logging.

---

**Issue #2: GSAP Animations Not Visually Tweening (or partially working) Despite Correct Final Styles**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Elements animated with GSAP snap to their final position without smooth tweening.
    *   Only some elements in an animated set appear to move.
    *   Browser DevTools (Inspect Element) show that GSAP *is* correctly setting the final inline `transform` or `opacity` styles on the elements *after* the supposed animation duration.
*   **Potential Causes & Diagnostics:**
    1.  **CSS `transition` Conflict:** A CSS `transition` property defined on the same elements (or a parent affecting children) for the same properties GSAP is trying to animate (commonly `transform`, `opacity`). The browser's CSS transition engine "fights" GSAP's per-frame inline style changes.
        *   **Check:** Inspect the CSS rules for the animated elements in DevTools.
        *   **Fix:** **Remove or comment out the conflicting CSS `transition` property.** Allow GSAP to fully control the animation timing, easing, and property changes. This was the critical fix for the dot grid side-middle dots.
*   **Resolution (from session):** Advised and confirmed removal of `transition` property from `.brandon-dots-grid .brandon-dot` CSS rule.

---

**Issue #3: Incorrect Initial State of GSAP-Positioned Elements**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Elements intended to be in a specific layout (e.g., a 3x3 grid) appear stacked or incorrectly positioned on page load *before* any animation is triggered.
*   **Potential Causes & Diagnostics:**
    1.  **`gsap.set()` Application:** If using a function-based value with `gsap.set()` across a collection of elements, ensure GSAP correctly distributes the distinct values to each target.
        *   **Fix:** For robust initial positioning of multiple unique elements, iterate through the collection and apply `gsap.set()` to each element individually with its specific target properties.
    2.  **Overriding CSS `transform`:** Base CSS rules for the elements might apply a `transform` that conflicts with GSAP's initial `x` and `y` positioning.
        *   **Fix:** Remove conflicting base CSS `transform` properties if GSAP is intended to solely manage the element's position from a (0,0) relative origin.
*   **Resolution (from session):** Modified `initializeDotsGridMenu` to use a `forEach` loop to `gsap.set()` the initial `x` and `y` for each dot individually (v2.6.7.4).

---

**Issue #4: Semplice Overlay Menu Not Triggering Consistently from Custom Buttons**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Clicking custom elements (e.g., the dot grid icon, "WORK" button) that are intended to open the Semplice overlay menu fails to do so.
*   **Potential Causes & Diagnostics:**
    1.  **Event Handler Logic:** The JavaScript event handler might not be correctly identifying and programmatically clicking the Semplice theme's native menu trigger/hamburger icon.
        *   **Fix:** Use a robust set of selectors to find the Semplice hamburger (e.g., `.open-menu.menu-icon`, `.hamburger`, `[data-module="menu"] .hamburger`). Ensure `.click()` is called on the found element.
    2.  **JavaScript Errors:** Other JS errors in the script could prevent the event handlers from being attached or executing correctly.
        *   **Fix:** Resolve any preceding JS errors (especially syntax errors).
    3.  **Event Propagation/Default Prevention:** Incorrect use of `e.preventDefault()` or `e.stopPropagation()` could interfere.
        *   **Fix:** Ensure `e.preventDefault()` is used appropriately if the custom trigger is an anchor, but ensure it doesn't stop other necessary event flows.
*   **Resolution (from session):** Refined `initializeButtonHandlers` to reliably find and click the Semplice hamburger for any element classed `.brandon-work-menu-trigger` (v2.6.7.3 and maintained).

---

**Issue #5: Complete Loss of Custom Console Logs & Script Functionality**

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   No `[BRANDON CUSTOM]` log messages appear in the console on page load or interaction.
    *   All custom script functionalities (animations, event handlers) cease to work.
*   **Potential Causes & Diagnostics:**
    1.  **JavaScript Syntax Error:** This is the most common cause. A single syntax error (e.g., missing brace, comma, parenthesis, keyword typo) can prevent the entire JavaScript file from being parsed and executed by the browser.
        *   **Check:** Open the browser's Developer Console. It will usually report syntax errors and the line number on page load.
        *   **Fix:** Meticulously review the script for syntax errors, paying close attention to the area of the last change or the line reported by the browser.
*   **Resolution (from session):** Identified and fixed a missing opening curly brace in a `catch` block within `createSafeP5Instance` (v2.6.7.8).

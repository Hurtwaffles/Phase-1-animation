- Purpose: Dummy/test section for hero intro animation on unpublished/test pages.
- Used for: Masked line-by-line upward reveal of hero copy.
- Known conflicts: None, only applied to playtest sections.

2. .hero-copy-test
- Purpose: Inner container for hero text (section 1).
- Used for: GSAP/SplitText-like line-by-line reveal.
- Known conflicts: None, as long as unique to test/demo pages.

3. .section-select-projects-test
- Purpose: Dummy/test section for "Select Projects" title section on unpublished/test pages.
- Used for: Masked line-by-line bottom-up reveal.
- Known conflicts: None, only for test/play pages.

4. .select-projects-title-test

5. .masked-line / .masked-line-inner
- Purpose: Dynamically added by JS to wrap each text line for masking/reveal.
- Used for: Animation masking, line-by-line transition.
- Known conflicts: Do not manually add; always generate with SplitText/JS.
- Additional: `.is-revealed` state triggers CSS transition.

6. .brandon-bg-main-bg, .brandon-main-background
- Purpose: Applied to main section backgrounds for haze/dot grid p5.js animation.
- Used for: Container selection by background injector JS.
- Known conflicts: Multiple backgrounds can exist if SPA navigation not handled; clear/destroy old canvases on SPA events.

7. .brandon-bg-load-wave, .brandon-load-wave
- Purpose: Section and container for “load wave” animated background.
- Used for: Hero/intro background, p5.js wave reveal.
- Known conflicts: Same as above; ensure only one active per section.

8. .brandon-bg-main-bg2, .brandon-main-background2
- Purpose: For alternate (white) version of background on project pages.
- Used for: Matching dot grid haze, different color scheme (white bg, muted dots).
- Known conflicts: None, as long as grid config stays synced with .brandon-main-background.

9. .project-section--[project-name]  (e.g. .project-section--coors)
- Purpose: Unique per-project section class for reveal targeting, dot color, scroll triggers, and sticky nav dot.
- Used for: Animations, scroll-to, and project indicator dot color logic.
- Known conflicts: If duplicated, ensure data attributes or class are unique per project.

10. .project-reveal, .reveal
- Purpose: Shared animation targeting for project image/title reveals.
- Used for: GSAP ScrollTrigger, SplitText line masking.
- Known conflicts: None, best for batch selection in JS.

11. .scroll-to-dot
- Purpose: Right gutter sticky project nav dot.
- Used for: GSAP sticky/fade/scale/hover/reveal animation, color set via class or data attribute.
- Known conflicts: Only one dot should be sticky per project in view; reverse animation if scrolling back up past section.

12. .about-section, .about-reveal
- Purpose: About section and its animated elements.
- Used for: On-appear GSAP/SplitText reveal for each element (copy, headline, images).
- Known conflicts: None; ensure targets are not nested inside other .reveal elements to avoid double animating.

# Notes:
- For all selectors, ensure Semplice-generated wrappers do not alter/override intended structure.
- If DOM structure changes, update selectors here and in scripts.
- For debugging, always cross-check with actual class names in DevTools.
- Keep selector log current with all new sections/components.

## Selector & DOM Element Log - Semplice Child Theme

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-15 23:55:56 UTC
**Purpose:** Log key CSS selectors and JavaScript element IDs/classes used for targeting and manipulation.

---

### Dot Grid Menu Animation:

*   **Container ID (JS):** `brandonDotsGridMenu`
    *   Purpose: Main `div` element containing the 9 dots for the animated menu icon. Targeted by `document.getElementById()`.
*   **Individual Dot Class (JS & CSS):** `.brandon-dot`
    *   Purpose: Class applied to each of the 9 `div` elements within `#brandonDotsGridMenu`. Used by `querySelectorAll()` in JS and for base styling in CSS.
    *   CSS Styling Context: Requires `position: absolute;` within `#brandonDotsGridMenu` (which should be `position: relative;`). `transform-origin: center center;`. GSAP controls `transform (x, y, scale)` and `opacity`. **CSS `transition` property on this class MUST be removed/commented out to prevent conflicts with GSAP.**

---

### Overlay Menu Triggers:

*   **Custom Trigger Class (JS):** `.brandon-work-menu-trigger`
    *   Purpose: Applied to any custom element (e.g., `#brandonDotsGridMenu`, "WORK" text button/link) that should trigger the Semplice overlay menu. Used in `document.addEventListener('click', ...)` to identify relevant clicks.
*   **Semplice Native Menu Trigger Selectors (JS - for programmatic click):**
    *   `'.open-menu.menu-icon'`
    *   `'.hamburger'`
    *   `'[data-module="menu"] .hamburger'`
    *   `'[data-menu-type="hamburger"] .hamburger'`
    *   Purpose: Used in sequence by `document.querySelector()` to find the Semplice theme's actual hamburger icon to be clicked programmatically.

---

### P5.js Backgrounds:

*   **Target Semplice Section Class (JS & CSS):** `smp-section.brandon-bg-main-bg` (example for main background)
    *   Variants: `smp-section.brandon-bg-load-wave`, `smp-section.brandon-bg-main-bg2`
    *   Purpose: Identifies the Semplice `<smp-section>` element that should host a P5.js background.
    *   CSS Styling Context: Requires `position: relative;` (can be set by JS if static). Must have a defined `height` or `min-height` (e.g., `100vh`) for the P5 canvas to fill.
*   **Dynamically Created P5 Container Div Class (JS & CSS):** `div.brandon-main-background` (example)
    *   Variants: `div.brandon-load-wave`, `div.brandon-main-background2`
    *   Purpose: `div` element dynamically created by `injectBackgroundContainers()` inside the target `smp-section`. This `div` hosts the P5 canvas.
    *   JS/CSS Styling Context: Styled by JS with `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; pointer-events: none; z-index: 0;`.
*   **Semplice Content Wrapper (JS - for DOM insertion reference):** `.smp-content-wrapper`
    *   Purpose: A common Semplice element within sections. Used to correctly layer the P5 background `div` behind actual page content.
    *   JS/CSS Styling Context: If present, its `position` is set to `relative` and `z-index: 1` by JS to ensure it sits above the P5 background.

---

### General Animated Buttons & Links:

*   **Button/Link Selector (JS):** `'.brandon-animated-button-reveal, .brandon-logo-reveal-link'`
    *   Purpose: Used to attach press/release visual feedback animations and smooth scroll functionality.
    *   CSS Styling Context: Relies on CSS variables for transitions and `:active` or a JS-added `.pressed` class.

[Prompt for Brandon: "Add new selectors/classes and describe usage/known conflicts here whenever you introduce a new animation target or container."]
